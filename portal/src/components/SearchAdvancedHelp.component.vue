      By default, queries in Advanced Search are applied to all fields, however, this can be refined using the <i>All
        Fields</i> dropdown menu on the left. To search in more than one field, select <i>Add New Line</i> and specify
      the additional field you wish to search. To reset your search query, select <i>Clear</i>.
      The information entered in the Advanced Search text field is treated as part of a 'mini-language':
    </p>
    <p>
      - Your query specifications across multiple lines will be compiled as a single query string consisting of a series of search terms and operators which can be viewed by clicking the <i>Show Query</i> button.
    </p>
    <p>
      - In general, the search text is not case-sensitive. Exceptions to this are Boolean operators (see below).<br />
    </p>

  <el-row>
    <p class="py-2 font-bold">Boolean Operators</p>
  </el-row>
  <el-row>
    <p>
      The standard Boolean operators <code class="literal backdrop-blur">AND</code>, <code
        class="literal backdrop-blur">OR</code>
      and <code class="literal backdrop-blur">NOT</code> are supported in Advanced Search. These can either be added in
      the dropdown menu between fields when <i>Add New Line</i> is selected, or included within the search text field,
      using parentheses whenever multiple operators occur together.
    </p>

  <el-row>
    <p>
      For instance, to search for items that contain both 'rainbow' and 'lorikeet' or 'pink' and 'cockatoo' but not
      'galah', the query should be:
    </p>
  </el-row>
  <el-row>
    <p>
      <code class="literal backdrop-blur">((rainbow AND lorikeet) OR (pink AND cockatoo)) NOT galah</code>
    </p>
  </el-row>
  <el-row>
    <p>
      To search for the literal words AND, OR and NOT, add a backward slash (<code
        class="literal backdrop-blur">\</code>)
      before that word to 'escape' it, e.g. <code class="literal backdrop-blur">\OR</code>. Note that this is a
      situation
      where the search text is case-sensitive; 'and' does not need to be escaped, but 'AND' does. Escaping will not
      return
      case-sensitive matches; it will just prevent its use as a Boolean operator.

      Regular Expressions

  <el-row>
    <p>
      Some regular expression patterns can be used within the query string by surrounding the pattern in forward
      slashes,
      e.g. <code class="literal backdrop-blur">/gr[ae]y/</code> or <code class="literal backdrop-blur">/honou*r/</code>.
      Currently, regular expressions can only be used for complete word searches and not for partial words or phrases.
      This search function does not
      support full Perl-compatible regex syntax. For more information see:

    The following are reserved characters (i.e. part of the 'mini-language') that can have specific search functions and

  <li class="px-3 py-1">A term can be a single word -- 'quick' or 'brown' -- or a phrase, surrounded by double
    quotes -- "quick brown" -- which searches for all the words in the phrase, in the same order. NB: In the
    Basic Search box, multi-word expressions are treated as being linked by OR regardless of whether they have
    quote marks around them.
  </li>
  <li class="px-3 py-1">Wildcard searches can be run on terms consisting of a single word, using ? to replace a
    single character, and * to replace zero or more characters. Wildcards cannot be included in a phrase search.

  <li class="px-3 py-1">Regular expression patterns can be embedded in the query string by wrapping them in
    forward-slashes ("/"). This search engine does not support full Perl-compatible regex syntax, for more see:
